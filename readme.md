# Generating human face pictures with DCGAN
This repository consists of generating images using DCGAN, model was trained using the [CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA)](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) dataset from Kaggle, in This repo you can find a notebook named **GAN CelebA.ipynb** which generates images of size (28,28), the same notebook can be found on Google Colab by clicking on this [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IhabTALEB/Generating-human-face-pictures-with-DCGAN/blob/master/GAN%20CelebA.ipynb). Generated Samples are in the following picture.

In order to run this code on Colab, you need to download your kaggle.json file from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Webiste, save it in your Google Drive, and change the path of this file in the Section "Prepare Kaggle CLI" in the notebook.
